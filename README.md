## 💻 My Process

### Built with
- Angular
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
This was my **first Angular project** 🎉  
I had previously built the same challenge in **React**, and rebuilding it in Angular helped me:
- Understand component structure in Angular
- Work with `@Input()` to create reusable dropdowns
- Manage active/hover states with TypeScript and SCSS

### Continued development
- Add responsiveness (currently only desktop version)
- Deploy both Angular and React versions to compare

### Useful resources
- [Angular Docs](https://angular.dev/) – helped me with components and bindings
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) – for providing this challenge
